# ConfluencePS

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/AtlassianPS/ConfluencePS.svg)](https://github.com/AtlassianPS/ConfluencePS/releases/latest) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/viulo95g362l6vym/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AtlassianPS/confluenceps/branch/master) [![PowerShell Gallery](https://img.shields.io/powershellgallery/dt/ConfluencePS.svg)](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ConfluencePS) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)]

Automate your documentation! ConfluencePS is a PowerShell module that interacts with Atlassian's [Confluence] wiki product.

Need to add 100 new pages based on some dumb CSV file? Are you trying to figure out how to delete all pages labeled 'deleteme'? Are you sick of manually editing the same page every single day? ConfluencePS has you covered!

ConfluencePS communicates with Atlassian's actively supported [REST API] via basic authentication. The REST implementation is the only way to interact with their cloud-hosted instances via API, and will eventually be the only way to interact with server installations.
