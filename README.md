# ConfluencePS
A PowerShell module that interacts with Atlassian's [Confluence] wiki product.

ConfluencePS communicates via Atlassian's currently supported [REST API], which is the only way to interact with their cloud-hosted instances, and will eventually be the only way to interact with an on-premises installation.

## Install
* "Download ZIP" near the top-right of this page
* If necessary, unblock the zip
* Extract the ConfluencePS folder to a module path
  * For example, $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\

**NOTE:** The top-level ConfluencePS folder (that contains readme.md) is just for GitHub presentation. You'll want to keep the ConfluencePS child folder, discarding the top level.

```posh
# Import the module
    Import-Module ConfluencePS
# Alternatively,
    Import-Module C:\ConfluencePS
    Import-Module \\server\share\ConfluencePS

# Get commands in the module
    Get-Command -Module ConfluencePS

# Get help
    Get-Help Get-ConfPage -Full
    Get-Help about_ConfluencePS
```

## Examples
Not yet included here while the module is still in constant development. In the interim, you can always:
```posh
Get-Help New-ConfPage -Examples
```

## Acknowledgments
Many thanks to thomykay for his [PoshConfluence] module, which gave me enough of a starting point to feel comfortable undertaking this project.

I ~~stole~~ repurposed much of RamblingCookieMonster's example module, [PSStackExchange], which was a huge help in standing up everything correctly.
