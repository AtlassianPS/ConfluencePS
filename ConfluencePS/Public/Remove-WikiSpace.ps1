function Remove-WikiSpace {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Remove an existing Confluence space.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Delete an existing Confluence space, including child content.
    "The space is deleted in a long running task, so the space cannot be considered deleted when this resource returns."

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-WikiSpace -ApiURi "https://myserver.com/wiki" -Credential $cred -Key ABC,XYZ -Confirm
    Delete the space with key ABC and with key XYZ (note that key != name). Confirm will prompt before deletion.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-WikiSpace | Where {$_.Name -like "*old"} | Remove-WikiSpace -Verbose -WhatIf
    Get all spaces ending in 'old' and simulate the deletion of them.
    Would simulate the removal of each space one by one with verbose output; -WhatIf flag active.
