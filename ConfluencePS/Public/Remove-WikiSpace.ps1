    .SYNOPSIS
    Remove an existing Confluence space.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Delete an existing Confluence space, including child content.
    "The space is deleted in a long running task, so the space cannot be considered deleted when this resource returns."

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-WikiSpace -Key XYZ -Confirm
    Delete a space with key XYZ (note that key != name). Confirm will prompt before deletion.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-WikiSpace -Name ald | Remove-WikiSpace -Verbose -WhatIf
    Get spaces matching '*ald*' (like Reginald and Alderaan), piping them to be deleted.
    Would remove each space one by one with verbose output; -WhatIf flag active.
